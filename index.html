                    <p>Reden's a tool I've been working on recently that's intended to allow the ease of use of a Docker-powered, Vagrant-backed development environment accessible from anywhere with minimal set-up.</p>
                    
                    <p>Firstly, let's see if Reden would be valuable to you. It allows you to:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilise a cloud-based development environment</li>
                        <li>Work offline (as fully as online)</li>
                        <li>Use your favoured tools, IDEs and the like</li>
                        <li>Keep standardised environments across work or home with minimal setup (hell, in space if you wanted)</li>
                        <li>Access all services via SSH</li>
                        <li>Keep development teams in sync by having code and work centralised to a singular server</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I designed this tool for my own personal use; I work across varying languages and projects and, with the dependencies for each project being so wildly different, I started to find it difficult to manage or even understand what my dependencies were.</p>
                    
                    <p>I, of course, then tried Docker-provisioned Vagrant boxes as an alternative, but my workload would then be slowed down hugely if the machine I was on at the time was particualrly slow. We needed something better, so I created Reden.</p>
                    
                    <p>The idea was to produce user-unique "workspaces" on a remote server, allowing environments to be entirely seperate from a user's machine; no more downloading and running VMs locally.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>To demonstrate how easy Reden is to set up and use, let's go straight ahead see what it's like to set up on a brand new machine. We'll assume for the moment that the Reden server we're communicating with is already set up,</p>
